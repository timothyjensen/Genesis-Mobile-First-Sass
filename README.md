# Genesis Starter Child Theme

This is a developer-friendly starter child theme for the [Genesis framework](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/), using Gulp and Sass. The build process uses [Gulp WP Toolkit](https://github.com/craigsimps/gulp-wp-toolkit) and the stylesheet takes a mobile-first approach.

## Dependencies

- [Genesis framework](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/)
- PHP 7+
- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine

## Installation

In the theme root run the command `npm install && gulp build`. This will build the stylesheet, concatenate and minify JavaScript files.

All feedback, bug reports, and pull requests are welcome.
